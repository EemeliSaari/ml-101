## Exercise 1

### Goal:

Goal of this exercise was to get familiar with the most common tools for machine learning and data analysis in Python. Aim was to load data, normalize it and then plot it.

### Methods:

Data can be easily loaded using numpy libraries loadtext function. Numpy also provides tools to quickly take mean or standard deviation of any given numpy array.

Plotting was done using Matplotlib and mpl_toolkit (for 3D plotting). There was some weird tricks considering the usage of mpl_toolkit since it was only used as a import to make plots projection='3d' work.

### About data:

Data was a .csv file of location coordinates: x, y, z
